<h1>Redesigning website</h1>
<br>
<div class="box">
    <h1 class="article-radical">Y</h1>es i refactor it again, i wasn't satisfied with current system on which website was stood,
    so i rewrited it, removing some of the stuff that was too small for having a page and just be article or blog post or like assets
    folder page with free meme templates i never use it, and i don't want maintain it. And some articles (were called minipages) were
    not moved because they were depricated, or because like dislaimer was overkill and i just put it on the articles where politics
    involved so people actually saw that.
    <br><br>
    So what i changed besides removing stuff, well i simplified code base, old code base were made using
    <a href="https://github.com/Lsalwestfox/MultiPurposeBuildSystem">Multi purpose build system</a>, a discontinue, crappy system that i wrote mainly
    to replace cmake because i were refused to learn it, and then i know cmake, MPBS is just utter garbage. Some stuff was broken so i
    were to execute some obscure linux commands to do stuff. Now there's no build system, what you see on the site repo is all codebase.
    <br><br>
    Old codebase had mpbs script that generates html content for things like blog on compile-time instead of js scripts at the runtime, which
    is my bad, js ran this code very fast and no optimization were required and instead codebase just became more complex and bigger for no reason,
    so now it reverted back to loading blog posts from javascript big array, and i just write to buffer and set html content to buffer to prevent
    flickering.
    <br><br>
    The script also had curl stuff, script would query all img tags with src and downloads them in the curl and sets src to the donwloaded file,
    i don't know what i though while doing that it's just bullshit. It had also more fancy worhless formatting, like splitting one .scss file
    into multiple .css files, even if you could just use style tag, or title bug fancy which expands to icon setter also, why idk.
    <br><br>
    But the thing wich was really bad is minipage handling, script were just parse some first tag on each file in directory, which is even
    limiting, since if in the same folder were image that handeled by minipage it would just break since it's not html.
    <br><br>
    Also there were small changes, like in look, background menu how have instead of white lines, lines of color followed by hue of background
    and not too light, so you can read text better as a side effect. And buttons to the pages no longer just index. Also entrance were removed
    bcs were no reason to it be.
    <br><br>
    Also i removed everything from evil blog because i lazy to move stuff, but don't care it's shitposting were anyway. And also i made quotes
    fancier.
