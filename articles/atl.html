<div class="box">
    <h1 class="article-radical">I</h1> had a lot of time and a schedule, but it's static one, so i made todo list that not only adds tasks but also
    tracks tasks at specific point of time, for example you need to remember something, to remember best, since brain remembers throgh recall and not repetition,
    you need to recall it 6-min per day and each 1, 3, 7, 30-th day to repeat what you learned to refresh, the only expection it not works probably, theoretically with
    big numbers of random ass physics constant, because no person can remember that, it's only for google, so ATL made for situations like that, here's hot do it,
    <br><br>
    <code>atl crtwatering Remember physics</code><br>
    <code>atl crtkaizen Remember physics, but 6 minutes</code><br>
    <br>
    But it can be for more stuff, imagine you need metting tommorow, well
    <br><br>
    <code>atl crttommorow Metting with random ass braindead</code><br>
    <br>
    or, you can use <code>crtperiod</code> to get some period of time task applied:
    <br><br>
    <code>atl crtperiod 90 winter</code>
    <br><br>
    or you can type <code>atl help</code> so you understood what it can do, you can also remove tasks if needed to, but they remove more than that,
    there's also REPL mode since when i run it with Visual Studio no arguments were passed so just typing atl it goes repl mode.
    <br><br>
    <h1 class="article-radical">T</h1>he code side of things were also simple, besides asking AI on how istringstream works since i don't even knew
    it existed in C++17, and also chrono since i hate it, and some 2 random ass calls that i probably not remember, everything was simple, code is under
    500 lines of code and there were very small amount of bugs, most of them were of bad knowledge of fstream.
