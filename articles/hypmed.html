<h1>Just use hypermedia</h1>
<br>
<div class="box">
    <h1 class="article-radical">H</h1>ypermedia, it's basically means html but i use hypermedia sometimes because i liked term.
    Most of the time on the web being used js framework, a.k.a. react a.k.a. server runs typescript and then gets request from the user
    then it goes through polymorphic hellscape which is clean code, generating json generator for html code that is going to the site
    other polymorphic clean code abomination, reads json and creates html. Why not just send html to the user?<br><br>Well according to
    avarage redditor says it's for API, or that it's compbility. But it's not, first of all you can just write 2 entry points it's
    not that hard, they use the same data. And second, this is thing is pure a.k.a. from the same json the same html is generated, always,
    no matter where you send it, so you can easily just send html and set html contents of the element.<br><br>
    
    <h1 class="article-radical">A</h1>nd i'm gonna "react" to the htmx article about why <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/htmx-sucks/">"htmx sucks"</a>
    from creator of htmx, which is good library that better than js frameworks, i probably don't agree on most if not all points of article

        real work being done in web development, things like React Server Components,
        Svelte Runes and Signals that are actually pushing the state of the art forward.

    Name 1 js framework that not literaly the same as everyone other that not htmx or his
    son apline js. Also say differences between server components, hooks or just regular
    components, yes there's none. I remember app being you host things on endpoints and you
    call them with arguments and server does stuff returns other stuff. Why you need
    overcomplicate stuff? Yes it's art, but while in art and aestetics maximalism is good
    but in code world, code must be minimalistic and simplier, becoming good, it's actually
    hard to make things simple

        First of all, consider the code for htmx. <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/master/src/htmx.js">Look at this garbage.</a>

    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Look at codebase of avarage company, it's literaly the same shit. Also htmx works so you can just ignore that unless it's really hurts

        Worst of all, it's just one big ball of JavaScript! One file! It isn't decomposed at all.
        If this person took one of my <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/directory/2256398/carson-gross">classes at MSU</a>
        I would fail them based solely on this complete misunderstanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of Concerns</a>,

    <br>
    htmx is a client-side library it's must be a one javascript file for ease of use. Also
    by you're own logic you need take you're own classes because you don't know about
    separation of concerns? why i say this? the guy who sad it also wrote htmx. Also
    can be multiple modules in one file so separation of concerns in one file if you need
    modules in a funcking client side library

        The next red flag is the lack of a build step.
        <footer>- htmx's article</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    no build step is good actually, also javascript don't have build step
    <br><br>
    <blockquote>
        If you look closely, even though they claim to not have a build step, they
        <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/bedee219329117fff8d58e33678d82f7c34b08b5/package.json#L30">actually do</a>
        have a build step, it's just an ad hoc set of bash scripts they wrote themselves.
        Ridiculous and dishonest. Shameful.
        <footer>- htmx's article</footer>

    <br>
    using language to automate repetitive tasks that designed to automate repetitive
    tasks is a crime now? are you kidding? I used bash commands in my site build step
    too and it's even worse. I literaly create directory then remove directory but not
    it's children and touch file that have name of removed directory just to create file
    with it's subfolders, this is literaly will be considered geneva convetion violation
    by you're logic.

        Despite the <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-typescripts-benefits-pitfalls/">obvious benefits</a>
        of <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> for a project like htmx, the authors have stubbornly resisted using it.
        Part of this is their irrational opposition to a build step (which they actually have, btw!) but part of it is a ridiculous commitment to
        "shipping debuggable source code"

    <br>
    It's just javascript's JDoc with a build step that adds layer of abstaction for no reason
    The only reason to use typescript is to convert it to lua a.k.a. writing things like nvim
    configurations with typescript.

        OK, well, if you haven't noticed, HTML is over thirty years old now. It's ancient.
        And, moreover, we have lots of experience with the approach these guys are recommending.
        <footer>- htmx's article</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    No the most experience is handling .json files and building html on client because
    server can't simply return html. Oh wait server can return .html php alrealy do
    that
    <br><br>
    Now, the next chapter is <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/htmx-sucks/#no-components">No Components</a>.<br>
    Htmx has components and you can do SPA easily with it, just host hmtl<br><br>
    <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/htmx-sucks/#no-front-end-back-end-split">No Front-End/Back-End Split</a>.<br>
    Look at href attribute it shock you. If you don't know what i'm talking about you should have been read this chapter.
    <br><br>
    <blockquote>
        Leaving aside if the Front-End/Back-End split is good or not, we can definitively say that Back-End engineers make garbage user interfaces.
        Just look at the htmx website. You've got inline styles, tables, a bunch of image tags didn't have alt descriptions forever. Just a dogs breakfast of bad HTML,
        from people who are trying to tell us to use HTML! You should leave your user interfaces in the hands of people who understand how to properly build them,
        and those people are, today, mostly Front-End SPA developers.
        <footer>- htmx's article</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Front-End developers are just people that draw solid color squares in figma, i'm kidding they just copy-pasting the same patterns of boxes into figma, the
    avarage website is so avarage, minimalistic, soulless, ugly and monochronic you can just replace all front-end developers with AI. I'm often against AI in art
    but modern interface is not art, it's just ugly minimalism that thinks it's better than previous styles like aero or 95, but it doesn't.
    <br><br>
    And if you don't care about aestetics aestetics and care only about functional aestetics, UI's build by front-end developers still bad, they have 90% of empty space
    which means you need scroll more, because there's only 2 colors (black and white) and don't have depth everything just blends, is that text a button? idk is this a link? idk,
    and from financial standpoint you may think well it's cheaper to do flat design than aero, i mean no one will remember, and just forgets you because you don't have
    any brand recognision but whatever.
    <br><br>
    And perfomance? bro it's not that expensive, css have 16 million colors available to choose, transitions and even 3d matrix
    transformations and filters that no one uses, and there's also canvas and js, you see a background of my main page, i replicated from terraria mod, it's just 69 lines
    of crappy js code, including formatting like empty lines and other, and including code to rotate title of the main page. Other effects may be 1k lines of code but don't
    say you care about bandwitch when you have 20MB of traffic for a recipe website. And older sites even at 90's were better and with modern tech can be written theoretically
    even without js, just css. You can make from raw html into servisable article text with 8 lines of css, here's they:
    <br><br>
    <blockquote>
        <pre>body {
    margin: 40px auto;
    max-width: 650px;
    line-height: 1.6;
    font-size: 18px;
    color: #444;
    padding: 0 10px;
}</pre>

    So maybe front-end dev makes ui the same as back-end dev, if not worse.

    <blockquote>
        Sometimes the htmx author will make a smart-alec comment like “Well, how do you feel about the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#href">href</a>
        attribute?”, but that's different, obviously.

    <br>
    It's from <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/htmx-sucks/#xss-vulnerabilities">XSS vulnerabilities chapter</a>, trying to say how htmx is unsafe because
    of XSS vulnerabilities, but it's just back-end dev that forgot to sanitase user input, it's just skill issue.
    <br><br>
    <blockquote>
        Getting back to the more technical side of things, if you adopt htmx and you want to also have a mobile app
        or an API for 3rd parties to use, you will need to create that API entirely separately from your web application's end points.
        <footer>- htmx's article</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Okay, because you probably use js framework you use `val: ${val}` semantics for json, guess what html is the same just different syntax, same data,
    same process, say everything just return value different, so don't shit saying it's hard. Also if you make mobile app with electron, i show you a surprise:
    document.querySelectorAll, and don't say you care about perfomance your recipe website takes 7 seconds to load because of ads.
    <br><br>
    <blockquote>
        Another technical issue with htmx is that it just won't scale. It may work for small applications,
        but as applications get larger the htmx model breaks down and becomes a mess. The component model of React
        and other front-end tools keeps everything compartmentalized and testable.
        This makes it much easier to keep large codebases clean.
        <footer>- htmx's article</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Htmx model literaly can be used or used the same as react component model. And also can make single page
    application without 5 build 1 minute steps that broke after each update without being tied to javascript
